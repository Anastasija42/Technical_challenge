The lecture covers various segmentation techniques and introduces the concept of superpixels, which are described as visually homogeneous image regions created by partitioning an image into 'N' regions.  Which of the following best describes a key characteristic of superpixels, as presented in this lecture?",
            "correct_answer": "Superpixels provide a perceptually meaningful representation by grouping pixels with similar low-level properties.",
            "correct_explanation": "This option is correct.  The lecture materials define superpixels as \"visually homogeneous regions...where the pixels within a region share some low-level property (color, texture etc.)\". This directly supports the idea of perceptually meaningful representation.",

            "distractor1_explanation": "This option is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that superpixels are computationally *efficient*, reducing the complexity of images.  They reduce the number of processing units from hundreds of thousands (or millions) of pixels to only a few hundred (or thousand) superpixels.",
            "distractor2": "Superpixels inherently lose significant image detail, resulting in substantial information loss.",
            "distractor2_explanation": "This option is incorrect. The lecture notes highlight that superpixels are \"near-complete,\" meaning there's minimal information loss when moving from a pixel-grid to a superpixel map. Most image structures are conserved.",
            "distractor3": "Superpixels are primarily useful for high-resolution images, and their effectiveness decreases with lower resolutions.",
            "distractor3_explanation": "This option is incorrect. The lecture does not limit the application of superpixels to high-resolution images only. The applicability of superpixels is related to the need for efficient image processing across various image resolutions and data types.  The lecture mentions the use of superpixels in both high and low-resolution images.",

One parameter sets the nominal size of the superpixels, and another parameter controls the balance between clustering appearance and spatial regularization.  What is the parameter that regulates the balance between these two aspects, and how is it defined in relation to the nominal size of the superpixels?",
            "correct_answer": "Regularizer (R); it is defined as the ratio of the Region Size (RS) to 1.",
            "correct_explanation": "Correct. The text explicitly states that the regularizer (R) sets the trade-off between clustering appearance and spatial regularization and that this is achieved by setting R/RS = 1.  This means R is defined as being equal to RS.",
