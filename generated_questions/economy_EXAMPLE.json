        "correct_explanation": "Explanation: While the text discusses inflation in the context of productivity and real wages, high levels of inflation leading to wage stagnation is not specifically cited as a major pre-pandemic concern.  The focus is more on low productivity and the complexities of wage dynamics related to migration.",
        "distractor1": "Low productivity and competitiveness within the EU.",

        "correct_explanation": "This is incorrect. While the text discusses the dangers of inflation and potential future banking crises, it does NOT mention raising interest rates as a governmental strategy. Instead, it highlights the use of expansionary monetary policy (lowering interest rates) and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy.  This option directly contrasts with the described government actions.",

        "correct_explanation": "This option is also correct and directly addresses the core challenge presented in the question. The text clearly explains how differences in unemployment benefits and housing markets negatively affect labor mobility within the Euro Area, hindering the effectiveness of a monetary union.",
        "distractor1": "The inherent conflict between promoting economic specialization for efficiency gains and pursuing diversification to mitigate country-specific shocks.",
        "distractor1_explanation": "This option is correct because the question directly points out the tension between specialization and diversification, and how that tension relates to labor mobility impacted by differences in unemployment benefits and housing. The text explicitly states that differences in these areas harm labor mobility, a key criterion for a successful monetary union.",
        "distractor2": "The need for substantial fiscal transfers between regions to act as automatic stabilizers, particularly in the absence of a strong federal budget.",

The text explicitly states that this approach only provides a temporary solution (“put off the fire, but leave your house a complete mess”) and fails to address the underlying structural problems leading to the current account deficit.  The text highlights that structural policies are the only way to solve these deficits permanently.",

These challenges, coupled with low interest rate environments, necessitated unconventional measures like LTROs (longer-term refinancing operations) and QE (quantitative easing). What is a primary concern regarding the effectiveness of these unconventional monetary policies?",
        "correct_answer": "Unconventional monetary policies effectively alleviate money market pressures but have limited success as economic stimulus.",
        "correct_explanation": "This option is correct. The passage directly states that unconventional measures like LTROs and QE, while helpful in alleviating money market pressures caused by financial instability, had limited effectiveness as an economic stimulus.",
        "distractor1": "Unconventional monetary policies are highly effective in stimulating economic growth, but may lead to inflation.",
        "distractor1_explanation": "This option is incorrect because the text explicitly states that while unconventional measures are helpful in alleviating money market pressures, their effectiveness as an economic stimulus is limited.  The text does not suggest they *always* lead to inflation, only that they are a necessary but not sufficient solution.",
        "distractor2": "Unconventional policies are ineffective in addressing the underlying issues of sovereign debt and banking risk.",

        "correct_explanation": "Explanation for D: The provided text does not include a category such as \"moderate imbalances requiring minor adjustments\" within the streamlined classifications of the MIP.  The categories focus on the severity of the imbalances (no imbalances, imbalances, excessive imbalances) and whether a corrective plan is needed.  A \"moderate\" category is not defined within the described system.",

These plans must be approved by which body, and what potential consequence faces Euro area members repeatedly failing to comply?",
        "correct_answer": "The Council of the European Union; potential sanctions, including fines.",
        "correct_explanation": "Correct. The passage explicitly states that Corrective Action Plans under the Excessive Imbalance Procedure must be approved by the Council, and that repeated failures to comply can result in sanctions, including fines, for Euro area members.",
        "distractor1": "The European Central Bank; expulsion from the Eurozone.",

        "distractor2_explanation": "Incorrect. The European Commission plays a significant role in monitoring and recommending actions, but the final approval of Corrective Action Plans and the imposition of sanctions rests with the Council.  Loss of voting rights is not mentioned in relation to the EIP.",

Which of the following best describes the primary economic challenge that prompted Portugal's adoption of expenditure-reducing policies, such as tax increases and government spending cuts, during one of its adjustment programs?",
        "correct_answer": "A sovereign debt crisis characterized by increased risk, reduced credit availability, and a resulting fall in demand.",
        "correct_explanation": "This is correct.  The passage explicitly states that the 2011 bailout was due to a sovereign debt crisis, which increased risk, decreased credit, lowered demand, and created a negative GDP gap.  This crisis directly led to the implementation of expenditure-reducing policies as a solution.",
        "distractor1": "A current account crisis stemming from excessive imports exceeding exports and an inability to finance this deficit.",

        "correct_explanation": "This is the correct answer. The text explicitly states that frozen rents created excess demand for rental housing because prices did not reflect market forces. Simultaneously, the low rental yields discouraged landlords from offering their properties, leading to reduced supply.",
        "distractor1": "Increased housing supply and decreased demand, leading to lower construction activity.",
        "distractor1_explanation": "This option is incorrect because the frozen rents did not lead to increased housing supply; instead, they resulted in a contraction of supply. Landlords were not incentivized to offer rental properties due to low returns, leading to less construction. The market did not become more balanced but severely imbalanced.",
        "distractor2": "A balanced market where prices adjusted efficiently to meet supply and demand.",

        "correct_explanation": "This is correct. The text explicitly states that the snowball effect of migration is driven by decreasing costs (due to existing communities), family reunification, and imitation of successful migrants, thus explaining the growth rather than stabilization of migration flows.",
        "distractor1": "The consistently high costs associated with Mediterranean sea crossings.",
        "distractor1_explanation": "This is incorrect. While the text mentions high costs of migration as a factor, it emphasizes that these costs *decrease* over time due to established migrant communities, facilitating further migration—the opposite of the statement.",
